# MongoDB Alert

When you use Whaleal to manage a host for the first time, Whaleal will detect that the host is a new host and initialize it. The alarm method directly inherits the alarm indicators in the current project. If you want to configure different alarm indicators in the project, you can select the host where the server is located in the MongoDB drop-down box in MongoDB Alert and configure it separately.

## Select Project

1. Click Alert in the navigation bar.
2. Click MongoDB Alert on the Alert Message page.
3. In the MongoDB drop-down box, select the server for which you want to configure an alarm.

## Send alerts

When the alarm value is triggered, we can see the current alarm in open Alert, and we can search in MSG or configure the time interval to view the alarm within a period of time.

Alert will also send the alert to a specific platform through the information configured in the alert platform configured in Groups in the Project. For the configuration process, refer to [Project Alert](./03-ProjectAlert.md).
